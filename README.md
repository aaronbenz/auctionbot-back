# auctionbot-back

This was an awesome project made in collaboration with a team at atxHack4Change - http://atxhackforchange.org/

We created a working prototype that allowed Silent Auctions to be hosted via a Facebook Bot on Messenger. The idea is simple - create an easier and more accessible way for non-profit charities to hold auctions and raise more money. With Auction Bot, charities can create a social media campaign on FB, and interested parties can quickly start bidding, be notified they got outbid, and hopefully, bid more!

This repo is a flask api w/ sql db that was used as the backend process to talk with the Facebook Bot API.
